## Mycofile: A Flask RESTful API for cultivators

### Introduction

Mycofile is designed specifically for amateur mycologists but may be of use to cultivators of many varieties. The service acts as a culture library and cultivation log, allowing the tracking of steps in the expansion of mycelial masses. 

### Technical Outline

A Flask RESTful API forms the foundation of the service and communication occurs via JSONified messages. A SQLite database and SQLAlchemy complete the current backend configuration. A React.js client is currently under production.
